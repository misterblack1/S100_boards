Random S100 boards I have. Any help identifying these so I could possibly get them working would be appreciated.

The Versa Floppy I card is described here:

> Most cards were purchased as kits and were supplied with SDOS which was SD-Systems CPM configured to work with their Z80 card and monitor.  However SD-Systems supplied a complete BIOS source code and small diagnostic program source code that allowed you to configure SDOS (CPM) for your own system. One reason the Versafloppy caught on so quickly was that it offered a relatively simple way for cassette based software users to tackle the "chicken or egg" problem of being able to write a disk operation system BIOS before actually having a disk operating system running to edit, assemble and store the files. At the time IMSAI or Altair assumed you were talking to their hardware for their controller board. With the SD Systems diagnostic Versafloppy program they supplied an option to format, read and write disk sectors. You could load their SDOS system into RAM, patch in links to your consol IO and get a basic system going quickly. To this day I still remember the feeling of great accomplishment I felt the first time I saw my disk directory appear on my CRT. It made the hours of hardware building and debugging all worthwhile.

I have so far been unable to locate documentation or software for this card as mentioned above.
